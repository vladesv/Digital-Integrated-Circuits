# Digital Integrated Circuits (Vivado + Basys3)
This repository contains my laboratory work for the Digital Integrated Circuits course. The experiments, designs, and simulations are implemented in VHDL using Vivado.

Each folder contains the VHDL source files and testbenches used to solve that lab’s tasks (combinational and sequential logic design + simulation).
